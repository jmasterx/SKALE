# SKALE
2D SKeletal Animation Layer for Entities

This is a small library I made in 2011. I wanted to learn more about Skeletal Animation and Inverse Kinematics and decided to turn it into a library that might be useful for others.

An example binary for Windows is included showcasing the Inverse Kinematics functionality.
